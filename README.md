# Droidly
 Build Android apps with Blockly.
 
 This project is made up of two parts:
 1. **droidly-builder-frontend**: Blockly based website, where user can put blocks and generate app's code file.
 2. **droidly-builder-backend**: Backend which coordinates compilation and APK file generation process.
 3. **droidly-app**: App project's "skeleton", where backend puts the generated code file to start compilation process.
