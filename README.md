 Build Android apps with Blockly.
 
 This project is made up of two parts:
 1. Blockly based website, where user can put blocks and generate app's code file.
 2. Backend which coordinates compilation and APK file generation process.
 3. App project's "skeleton", where backend puts the generated code file to start compilation process.
